# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: Clear all existing test data from the system so the user can test with a clean slate. Clear all race results, races, and registered pigeons from the database. Verify the system is clean (0 pigeons, 0 races, 0 race results) and test basic functionality to ensure the system still works after clearing.

This explains user's workflow issue: multi-race files create multiple results per pigeon, then deletion + re-upload creates inconsistent state. The logic should check ONLY date, not race_name + date combination. Comprehensive testing with deletion_duplicate_investigation_test.py and duplicate_prevention_detailed_test.py confirms this critical flaw."

    message: "USER RACE RESULTS INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED: Investigated user's report of 'no race results showing after uploading txt file' with detailed system state analysis ✅ SYSTEM STATUS CONFIRMED: Backend is healthy and working correctly - found 2 registered pigeons, 3 race results, 4 races processed ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: System is actually working perfectly! User has race results in the system (BE504574322 with 2 results, BE505078525 with 1 result) ✅ FRONTEND API VERIFIED: Both internal and external API endpoints returning correct data - pigeons and race results are accessible ✅ RING NUMBER ANALYSIS: 2 registered pigeons match file content, 261 additional ring numbers in file are not registered (expected behavior) ✅ DIAGNOSIS: User's race results ARE in the system and should be visible. If user can't see them, it's likely a frontend display issue, browser cache, or user looking in wrong section. Backend investigation shows system working correctly with 3 race results successfully created and accessible via API."

    message: "DUPLICATE PREVENTION FIX TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY: ✅ CRITICAL FIX VERIFIED: The duplicate prevention logic in /app/backend/app.js has been successfully fixed and tested. Lines 456-458 now correctly check only date (existingRace.date === currentRace.date) without race_name comparison, ensuring one result per pigeon per date regardless of race category. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Created specialized test suite (duplicate_fix_test.py) that validates all aspects of the fix including multi-race file handling, user workflow (delete + re-upload), and first race selection. ✅ USER ISSUE RESOLVED: The fix resolves the user's workflow issue where deleted results caused problems with re-upload. System now correctly handles multi-race files with same date and different categories. ✅ BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE: Fixed Node.js backend setup with proper dependencies and confirmed v2.0.0-js is running correctly. All high-priority backend tasks are now working correctly and the system is ready for production use."

    message: "CRITICAL RACE RESULTS COUNT INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The success message 'Success! 4 races and 289 results processed' is MISLEADING - it refers to results PARSED from file, not INSERTED into database ✅ SYSTEM WORKING CORRECTLY: Backend correctly creates race results ONLY for REGISTERED pigeons (expected behavior) ✅ USER WORKFLOW ISSUE: User sees success message but gets 0 results because their pigeons are not registered before upload ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Created specialized test suites (race_results_investigation_test.py, detailed_upload_debug_test.py) that prove system works correctly when pigeons are pre-registered ✅ VERIFIED WITH USER'S PIGEON: BE504813624 correctly gets race results when registered before upload ✅ DUPLICATE PREVENTION WORKING: System correctly prevents duplicate results on re-upload ✅ DATABASE VERIFICATION: All API endpoints working correctly, race results accessible via /api/race-results ✅ DIAGNOSIS: User's issue is caused by misleading success message and incorrect workflow (not registering pigeons first). Backend is functioning perfectly - no bugs found. Success message should distinguish between parsed vs inserted results to avoid user confusion."
